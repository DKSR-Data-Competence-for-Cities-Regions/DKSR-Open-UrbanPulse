# DKSR Open-UrbanPulse
The DKSR Open UrbanPulse platform is the open source version of the UrbanPulse platform from The Urban Institute [ui!](https://www.ui.city/en/). It is an open urban real-time platform for cross-domain data integration and match-making. With UrbanPulse, the urban instituteÂ® has developed a real-time sensor data platform that follows the vision of Open Urban Platforms [OUP] as expressed by the European Innovation Partnership Smart Cities and Communities [EIP](https://e3p.jrc.ec.europa.eu/articles/european-innovation-partnership-smart-cities-and-communities) and defined in [DIN SPEC 913571](https://www.beuth.de/en/technical-rule/din-spec-91357/281077528). UrbanPulse is for cities, municipalities, utilities and enterprises that want to use new and existing urban data sources to create innovative value-added services. To this end, the [ui!] UrbanPulse platform enables both small and large cities and businesses to efficiently integrate new and existing data sources, process and analyze data in near real-time, and ultimately share the data with various stakeholders. Unlike many other platforms, [ui!] UrbanPulse can run in the cloud [such as Microsoft Azure], in container environments [Kubernetes] or in the local data center. Depending on the requirements, cloud-based services or open source technologies can be used for these purposes.
